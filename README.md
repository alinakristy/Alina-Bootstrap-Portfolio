# Alina-Bootstrap-Portfolio

Alina first bootstrap portfolio website.

## Description

In this project I had the opportunity to learn and  practice how to use bootstrap and create my first portofolio with this framework.

 ## Table content

 During this work I worked with the following:

- [HTML](#html)
- [CSS](#css)
- [Bootstrap](#bootstrap)
- The command line, also known as the terminal,Git and GitHub

## HTML

I used semantic HTML to create my portfolio webpage.


## CSS

 I used  Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), to add style to my  webpage.
 This is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.
 In this step I used:               
-  CSS costum responsive style for image in cards to make them look the same 
- Costum background colors
- Costum font size,  color
- CSS responsive design using Media Query

# Bootstrap

I  used Bootstrap to create the layout of my page, and also various helper methods to set up:
- layout(flex,grid)
- components ( jumbotron, cards,rows,navBar,etc.)
- helpers (boxing, sizing, colors, background, borders etc.)


When the page is loaded the page presents my name, and  a bar nav with links to  
- sections:
    - [about me](#about-me) 
    - [accomplishment](#accomplishment) 
    - [my projects](#my-projects)
    - [contact me](#contact-me) 


* When one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section

* When viewing the section about accomplishment  you will see section that is created with the help of bootstrap cards.

* When the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport

## Accomplishment

When viewing the section about my work , my education and my skills. you can see a cards section from bootstrap , that contain img  and links about my work and education and my projects.
 * My university https://usem.md/en
 * My job https://www.victoriabank.md/en
